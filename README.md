Netflix Titles Data Cleaning & Analysis
🚀 Overview
Welcome to the Netflix Titles Data Cleaning & Analysis repository! This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a raw dataset of Netflix titles to make it ready for further analysis. The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing text fields, and ensuring consistency in data types. Additionally, basic visualizations are provided to offer insights into the data.

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
The cleaning process includes:
Renaming Columns: All column headers are transformed to lowercase with underscores for uniformity.

Removing Duplicates: Duplicate rows are removed to ensure the dataset contains only unique records.

Handling Missing Values:

country: Missing values are replaced with 'unknown'.

rating: Missing values are filled with 'not rated'.

director and cast: Missing values are replaced with 'not specified'.

date_added: Missing values are filled with the most frequent date in the dataset.

Converting Date Formats: The date_added column is converted into a consistent datetime format.

Standardizing Text Columns: Text columns such as type, title, director, cast, country, and rating are standardized to lowercase and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.

Data Type Fixing: The release_year column is converted to integer data type.

🔧 Tools & Libraries
This project uses the following Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib: For plotting visualizations.

Seaborn: For creating beautiful and informative statistical graphics.

📊 Visualizations
After cleaning the dataset, the following visualizations are generated to provide insights:

Distribution of Content Type: A countplot showing the distribution of different types of content (movies and TV shows).

Top 10 Countries by Number of Titles: A bar plot highlighting the top 10 countries with the most Netflix titles.

Titles Added by Year: A line plot showing how the number of titles added to Netflix has evolved over the years.

📂 Dataset
The original dataset is a CSV file containing Netflix titles along with various attributes like type, title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, and date added.
